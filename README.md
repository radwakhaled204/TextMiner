TextMiner: Advanced Text Processing and Information Retrieval,
This project is divided into two main parts: text preprocessing and information retrieval. The first part involves reading text files and applying tokenization and stemming. The second part focuses on building a positional index, computing term frequency (TF), inverse document frequency (IDF), TF-IDF matrices, handling phrase queries, and ranking documents based on similarity scores.
